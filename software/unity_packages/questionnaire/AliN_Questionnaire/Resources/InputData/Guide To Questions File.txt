The application reads a Json file from here. 
File name should be: Questions.json
And the list of Questionnaire class name is “ListOfQuestions”
The first Item should be ID, a unique int or string  because it play as a KeyParameter.

Sample of  json format for Questions:
{
    "ListOfQuestions": [
        {
            "questionCategory": "ID",
            "questionLabel;": "ID",
            "questionText": "Participant ID",
            "mandatory": true
        },
        {
            "questionCategory": "Condition",
            "questionLabel;": "Experiment Location",
            "questionText": "Location",
            "mandatory": true
        },
        {
            "questionCategory": "Pre-experiment Questionnaire",
            "questionLabel;": "Q1",
            "questionText": "How do you feel Today?",
            "optionalAnswers": [ "Excellent", "Good", "Average", "Poor" ],
            "mandatory": false,
            "acceptMultipleChoice": false,
            "showinDropDown": true,
        }
    ]
}

The Questionnaire class has following properties:
public class Questionnaire
{
    //Question
    public int questionIndex;
    public string questionCategory;
    public string questionLabel;
    public string questionText;
    public List<string> optionalAnswers;
    public bool mandatory;
    public bool acceptMultipleChoice;
    public bool showinDropDown;
    public bool automatedDataCollection;

    //Answers
    public List<string> SelectedAnswers;
    public List<int> SelectedAnswersIndex;
    public string AnswerInText;
} 

So the complete version that can be used in json file is :
{
            "questionCategory": "Demographic",
            "questionIndex": 2,
            "questionText": "Participant ID",
            "optionalAnswers": [ "Excellent", "Good", "Average", "Poor" ],
            "mandatory": false,
            "acceptMultipleChoice": false,
            "showinDropDown": true,
    	    " automatedDataCollection ": false,



            "SelectedAnswers": [ "Average", "Poor" ],
            "SelectedAnswersIndex": [ 3, 4 ],
            "AnswerInText": "answer"
        }

BUT:
questionIndex do not need to be defined as it will be defined automatically by application. (The starting number for question index is 1 (not 0), the same for AnswersIndex for multiple choices. This adjustment happen for more readability of indexes in questionnaire as 0 doesn’t make sense)
Note: if optionalAnswers is empty the answer will be in Text format.
SelectedAnswers, SelectedAnswersIndex, AnswerInText are answers and shouldn’t be defined by Json file and later user will complete them. 

automatedDataCollection is indicating if this question is self-report answer or objective data collected by a device. Also This Item will be ignored to be created When QuestionUIGenerator called. 

questionLabel is the data labels in the Datalog file

So the necessary  format that need to be added in the json file for each field is : 
{
"questionCategory": "Demographic",
"questionText": "Participant ID",
"optionalAnswers": [ "Excellent", "Good", "Average", "Poor" ],
"mandatory": false,
"acceptMultipleChoice": false,
"showinDropDown": true,
}
